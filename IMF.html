<P>Figure 1. This immunofluorescence micrograph shows the ER being
labeled with a monoclonal antibody against the the chicken Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic
Reticulum ATPase (SERCA2) or calcium pump. The chicken cDNA was
transfected into COS1 cells, and the cells were later fixed, permeablilized,
and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. This photograph
was taken by Dr. A. Malcolm Campbell.</P>
